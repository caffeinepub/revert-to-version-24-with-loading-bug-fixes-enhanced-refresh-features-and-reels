# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix chat UI friend list display and feed post image rendering.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix ChatPage friend list sidebar to display all confirmed friends correctly
- Fix FeedPage PostCard component to properly render post images from backend blob data
- Ensure friend list updates dynamically when friendships change
- Handle empty states appropriately for both friend list and posts without images

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see their complete friend list in the chat sidebar and select any friend to chat with. Post images display correctly in the feed alongside captions.
